Not used Github before - we use SVN - but putting some code out there. First is Observer Enhancement

![Picture of the updated observer list](observerEnhancement.PNG)

This is javascript that can be included in your theme. I suspect this won't currently scale well if you have more than 100 observees. It hooks into the existing observee listing api calls, but adds a couple of calls for each observee.
